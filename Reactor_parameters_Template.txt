BelongsToTier=0				# 0=Uses virgin feed only, 1=thermal-spectrum, at least some feed comes from Tier-0 or 1 discharges, 2=fast-spectrum, at least some feed comes from Tier-0 or 1 discharges		
YearAvailable=2030			# Reactor availability year for the price driven simulation. Can be set to before simulation dates for a fully availavle reactor or after for an unused reactor
AllowedToUseSeparatedActinides	false	# can this facility draw upon separated, stored Pu and/or MA? (Will be irrelevant if feed is exclusively uranium)
PlantSize=1000.				# MW(e): all new facilities of this type have this capacity
DischargeBurnup=45.			# Equilibrium average discharge burnup [MWd/kgIHM]
ThermalEfficiency=35.			# percentage of thermal energy (MW(t)) converted to electricity (MW(e))(gross)
RecirculatingPower=2.0			# percentage of gross electric power recirculated to plant systems
Availability=85.			# load factor, probability that reactor is operating and producing power
CapitalCost=1700.			# overnight construction cost, $/kW(e)
AnnualFixedOM=68.			# yearly fixed (non fuel cycle) operations and maintenance, $/kW(e)/yr
InputUEnrichment=3.8			# percent U-235 in U.  If this is > NaturalUEnrichment, separative work will be used and the NU consumption will be appropriately incremented.
					# If this is <= NaturalUEnrichment but > TailsUEnrichment, no SW will be used but the NU consumption will be incremented.

%%%% COMMENTS ON COST DATA %%%%
# Costs below are one-time costs, $/kg of input feed stream, unless noted otherwise	
# Costs are assessed at 'DefaultLeadTime' or 'DefaultLagTime' as given in NFC_parameters.txt
# *Exception* Closed-cycle back-end processes (transportation, reprocessing, HLW vitrification, storage and disposal) are applied when the Pu or MA content of the SNF is demanded
# Entries of 'D' indicate that the default cost from NFC_parameters.txt is to be used.  Numerical entries will override those values.
# Units are $/kgIHM with these exceptions: mining&milling and conversion: $/kg U as U308, enrichment: $/SWU, HLW vitrification, storage, disp: $/kg HLW (fission products, actinide losses, unused separated Pu and MA)

%%%% COMMENTS ON REPROCESSING HIERARCHY %%%%
ReprocessHierarchy=0,1,2,3	# when looking for Pu and MA feed, the facility will first use separated Pu and/or MA if it's AllowedToUseSeparatedActinides
				# if it's not, or if not enough separated actinides are available, this list dictates the order in which SNF stockpiles will
				# be searched to find the necessary Pu and MA.  In this example, the reactors will search first for SNF from reactors of type 0 to be reprocessed.
				# if not enough of this SNF is available, SNF discharged from reactors of type 1 will be interrogated, and so on.
				# No SPACES between entries, please!  If reactors of this type do not demand any recovered Pu or MA feed, enter 'X'.	

IfCausesTiltReplaceWithType=3	# VEGAS attempts to build reactors according to the ScenarioRules in NFC_parameters.txt.  
				# if VEGAS tries to build a reactor of this type and 'Tilts' (finds that not enough Pu and/or feed is available to provide its lifetime supply),
				# the facility build will be cancelled.  This integer specifies which facility type VEGAS should build in its place.
				# note that IfCausesTiltReplaceWithType may specify a reactor type that might *also* 'Tilt'.
				# therefore, the chain of 'backup' facility types should eventually lead back to one that will definitely not 'Tilt' (i.e., only demands uranium feed).
